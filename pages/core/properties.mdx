# Properties

Important properties across the entire [structure](/index) are synchronised internally. External code can modify those parameters and listen to their changes.

The [concept](/core/properties/concept) and the [list](/core/properties/list) of properties are described in this section.

For external manilulation, there are [react hooks](/react-bridge/hooks/properties).
